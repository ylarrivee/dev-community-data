# Community Data

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/afilina/dev-community-data.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/afilina/dev-community-data)

The goal is simple: collect all data about technology events, current and historical for anyone to use in their applications, in order to make a stronger developer community.

Feel free to add your own record for your conference or user group, fix erroneous data or add additional fields.

## User Groups

The file [/data/user-groups.json](https://github.com/afilina/dev-community-data/blob/master/data/user-groups.json) lists all user groups. Leave "last_meetup" blank if still active.

Tip: add your entry to the top of file to avoid merge conflicts.

**Required Fields:** `key` (unique), `name`, `first_event`, `tags` ([allowable tag values](https://github.com/afilina/dev-community-data/blob/master/data/tags.json)).

```json
{
    "key": "example",
    "name": "Full user group name",
    "tags": ["php", "js"],
    "first_event": "yyyy-mm-dd",
    "last_event": "yyyy-mm-dd", 
    "locations": [
        {
            "name": "City, State (if applies), Country",
            "first_meetup": "yyyy-mm-dd",
